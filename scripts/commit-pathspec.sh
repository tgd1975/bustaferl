# scripts/commit-pathspec.sh — wrapper for git's pathspec-form commit
#
# This is the executable behind the /commit skill. It writes the
# provenance token at .git/cs-commit-token and runs
# `git commit -m "..." -- <files>`.
#
# The pre-commit hook validates the token and rejects commits that
# did not come from this wrapper. See docs/developers/COMMIT_POLICY.md
# for the full design.
#
# Untracked files: by default the wrapper rejects pathspec entries that
# are unknown to git with exit code 2. Pass --stage-untracked to opt
# into atomic in-wrapper staging — the wrapper detects untracked
# entries, `git add`s them itself, then commits, all in one process.
#
# Why an opt-in flag instead of always auto-adding: TASK-329 removed
# the original always-on auto-add because it masked parallel-session
# races (a foreign session could land a commit that adds the same path
# between the wrapper's untracked check and its `git commit`, producing
# two "successful" adds of the same file). The flag preserves that
# default-strict behaviour for any caller that wants race detection,
# while giving the /commit skill a way to handle untracked files
# without the agent typing `git add` (the project bans agent-typed
# `git add` via a deny rule in .claude/settings.json — see the
# no-git-add-use-commit-pathspec memory). The race window with the
# flag is one wrapper process; without it, the window spans
# skill-add + wrapper-commit (two processes) — so in-wrapper staging
# is strictly tighter than skill-side staging, just less strict than
# fail-fast.
#
# Renames and deletions ARE supported (TASK-347). The pre-flight check
# accepts any pathspec entry that is in HEAD or has an index entry —
# rename sources (after `git mv A B`, A is in HEAD but not in index)
# and on-disk-deleted tracked files both pass. Only paths unknown to
# both HEAD and index are rejected as truly untracked.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/commit-pathspec.sh "<message>" <file> [<file> …]
#   scripts/commit-pathspec.sh --no-verify "<message>" <file> [<file> …]
#   scripts/commit-pathspec.sh --stage-untracked "<message>" <file> [<file> …]
#   (flags may be combined; order does not matter)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  commit succeeded
#   1  commit failed (hook, git, or invalid args)
#   2  pathspec contains an untracked entry (and --stage-untracked
#      was not passed)

#
# Pathspec form requires every named file to be known to git in *some*
# capacity — either tracked in HEAD (so it can be modified or deleted)
# or staged in the index (so it can be added or rename-destinationed).
# The /commit skill is responsible for `git add`ing new files before
# invoking this wrapper; if any pathspec entry is unknown to git here,
# fail fast so the agent refreshes (and may discover a foreign-session
# commit) rather than silently adding.
#
# A naïve `git ls-files --error-unmatch -- "$f"` check rejects rename
# *sources*: after `git mv A B`, A is removed from the index and only
# B is present, so `ls-files A` fails — but A is not untracked, it is
# the source side of an in-progress rename and must reach the commit
# for git to record it as a rename rather than a delete + add. The
# correct primitive is: accept if the path is in HEAD OR has any index
# entry (add, modify, delete-source, etc.). Reject only if it is
# unknown to both.
